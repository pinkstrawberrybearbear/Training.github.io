	<h2 style="color:blue"><font face="Arial">Explore</h2>
	<p><font face="Arial">Jurong Lake Gardens, built around the beautiful Jurong Lake, will allow 
		for visitors to experience the natural landscapes of swamp forests and wetlands. In the 
		southern portion of Lakeside Garden, native wetland plant species such as the Nibung Palm 
		(Oncospermum tigillarium) and Lipstick Palm (Cyrtostachys renda) have been replanted to 
		restore the natural swamp forest habitat that was once thriving in the area.<br>
		<br><br><u>Nature Areas</u>
		<br><br>Visitors can stand on the boardwalk which overlooks into Alstonia Island, a man-made is
		land planted predominantly with Alstonia spatulata. The island is greatly influenced by 
		the changes in the water level of Jurong Lake and visitors can observe the changes in 
		biodiversity with the tides. Nature trails within the gardens will showcase coastal plants 
		such as Clusia to create various coastal habitats for biodiversity. Immerse yourself in a 
		flower field with butterflies fluttering around in the Butterfly trail. Right beside the 
		Garden House, you will see an expansive grassland habitat with bird hides scattered around 
		to allow for wildlife observation at close quarters without alarming them. Take a stroll 
		along the meandering Rasau Walk along the water’s edge to learn more about riparian 
		vegetation and animals. 
		<br><br>In the southern portion of Lakeside Garden, the Neram Streams features a 
		series of de-concretised and naturalised tributaries that mimic the natural streams 
		in the environment to channel stormwater runoff from the gardens into Jurong Lake. 
		The banks of the streams are planted up with semi-aquatic plants that provide a 
		suitable habitat for dragonflies and damselflies such as the Common scarlet (
		Crocothemis servilia). Adjacent to the streams is the Heron Island which has 
		natural platforms that encourage our resident herons to roost and nest away from 
		human disturbance.
		<br><br><br><u>Nature Trails</u><br>
		<br>Aside from these attractions, visitors can take a walk through the various nature 
		trails at various areas in Lakeside Garden.  These self-exploratory forest trails can be 
		found outside the PA Water Venture building, behind the Dog Run as well as the 
		southern-most section of the gardens. Look out for woodland birds such as the Spotted wood owl (Strix seloputo) and Laced woodpecker (Picus vittatus) roosting amongst the tree canopies as you stroll through the forest. 
		<br><br> There are also educational billboards placed around the gardens that provide information on the attractions and the biodiversity that can be found in the area. Use these billboards to plan a DIY trail around the gardens for your family or an educational tour for your children and students!
